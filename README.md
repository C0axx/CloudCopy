# CloudCopy
This script implements a cloud version of the Shadow Copy attack against domain controllers running in AWS. Any AWS user possessing the EC2:CreateSnapshot permission can steal the hashes of all domain users by creating a snapshot of the Domain Controller mounting it to an instance they control and exporting the NTDS.dit and SYSTEM registry hive file for use with Impacket's secretsdump project.
